maxent: Low-memory Multinomial Logistic Regression with Support for Text Classification

Description:	maxent is an R package with tools for low-memory multinomial logistic regression, also known as maximum entropy. The focus of this maximum entropy classifier is to minimize memory consumption on very large datasets, particularly sparse document-term matrices represented by the tm package. The classifier is based on an efficient C++ implementation written by Dr. Yoshimasa Tsuruoka.
